# Tshirt-Ordering
My IT professor wanted us to create a simple program where you can order multiple shirts, show total etc... The code includes making certain outputs have a certain color, read a text file and print the sum of the numbers that were in the file, writing data to a file, using the def function, etc... Constructive Critisizm is greatly appreciated
